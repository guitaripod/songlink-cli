# Songlink CLI

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/guitaripod/songlink-cli/total.svg)](https://github.com/guitaripod/songlink-cli/releases)

A Go program that retrieves Songlink and Spotify links for a given URL using the Songlink API. It also allows searching for songs and albums directly using Apple Music API. The output is designed to be shared as is, allowing the receiver to both use Songlink and listen to the song preview using Spotify's embed feature.

<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies for Download Features</strong></summary>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: yt-dlp Version Requirements

To use the download functionality (single tracks or playlists), you need:

- **`yt-dlp`** - For downloading audio from YouTube **(MUST be latest version)**
- **`ffmpeg`** - For audio/video processing

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** YouTube frequently changes their API, breaking older versions of yt-dlp. You **MUST** keep yt-dlp updated to the latest version or downloads will fail.

### Installing yt-dlp (Latest Version)

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
# Install and keep updated
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
brew upgrade yt-dlp  # Run regularly to stay updated
```

**Linux (Recommended methods for latest version):**

```bash
# Option 1: Direct download (always latest)
curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp
# Add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if not already there

# Option 2: pip/pipx (easy updates)
pipx install yt-dlp  # or: pip install --user yt-dlp
pipx upgrade yt-dlp  # Run regularly to stay updated

# Option 3: Package manager (may be outdated)
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg
# Note: apt version is often outdated. Consider Option 1 or 2 instead.

# Arch Linux (AUR version stays current)
yay -S yt-dlp-git ffmpeg  # yt-dlp-git auto-updates
# Or for manual updates:
yay -S yt-dlp ffmpeg
yay -Syu yt-dlp  # Run regularly
```

**Verify yt-dlp is up to date:**
```bash
yt-dlp --version
# Should show a recent date (within last month)
# If older, update immediately
```

### Troubleshooting Download Errors

If downloads fail with errors like:
- "Requested format is not available"
- "Signature extraction failed"
- "Some formats may be missing"

**This means yt-dlp is outdated.** Update it immediately:
```bash
# Quick update based on your system:
yt-dlp -U  # If installed via direct download
pipx upgrade yt-dlp  # If installed via pipx
brew upgrade yt-dlp  # macOS
yay -Syu yt-dlp  # Arch Linux
```
